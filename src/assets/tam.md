## **Instant-Impact Highlights**

* **Out-patient, local anaesthesia** — tiny 0.6 mm catheter; no stitches
* **50 – 80 % pain reduction** that lasts 1–2 years or longer
* **All-star indications:** Knee arthritis, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, facet-back pain, plantar fasciitis
* **Fast return to life:** Most patients back to desk work next day, sports in 7-14 days
* **Zero joint damage:** Preserves cartilage, tendons, nerves; repeatable if ever needed

## **Why Conventional Care Often Fails**

Painkillers hide symptoms but hammer your stomach & heart.
Steroid shots fade in weeks and speed up cartilage loss.
Surgery or joint replacement means anaesthesia, scars and months of rehab.
Radio-frequency ablations numb nerves but don’t heal tissue.

**Root problem:** abnormal micro-vessels and nerves (“neo-angiogenesis”) keep the joint inflamed.

## **Enter TAME — Switch the Pain Generator Off**

Our interventional radiologist guides a hair-thin catheter from the wrist to the **tiny arteries feeding the painful tissue**. Microscopic particles selectively block those vessels, starving the inflamed nerves of oxygen.
No incision in the joint, no foreign implant, just science-level precision that lets your body calm down and heal.


## **Who Is the Perfect Candidate?**

| ✅ Ideal for TAME                                       | ❌ Better Suited to Other Therapies                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Knee OA grades 1-3 with disabling pain                 | Bone-on-bone KL-4 knees ready for total replacement   |
| Frozen shoulder or rotator-cuff tendinopathy > 3 mo    | Acute full-thickness rotator-cuff tear needing repair |
| Tennis elbow / plantar fasciitis > 6 mo despite physio | Generalised inflammatory arthritis (RA, gout flare)   |
| Facet / SI-joint back pain confirmed on imaging        | Severe vascular disease blocking catheter access      |
| Patients wanting rapid recovery & low risk             | Pregnancy (delay until after delivery)                |

## **Your 5-Step Journey**

1. **Expert Consult (30 min video / clinic)** – review scans, confirm target vessel visibility.
2. **Morning Procedure** – wrist access, 40–60 min precision embolization.
3. **Relax 2 h & Discharge** – walk out on own feet.
4. **Day-3 Check-in** – mild ache resolves; many note pain drop already.
5. **Month-1 Review** – repeat VAS / WOMAC: typical 50 %+ pain fall; physio plan updated.
