                What Is UFE?
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
                Uterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE) is a non-surgical, scar-free treatment that treats fibroids through a simple pinhole in your wrist. A micro-wire is guided to the fibroid’s blood vessels and blocks their blood supply — shrinking the fibroids with no cuts or scars, no anesthesia, no hospital stay, and getting you home in a few hours.

                Fibroids are common, non-cancerous growths in the uterus in about 1 in 4 women and mostly require no treatment. In 5% (1 in 20) women though, they become large and cause:

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
                Once fibroids reach a certain size and symptoms become severe, painkillers stop working and a more permanent treatment becomes a necessity.

                <li>
                    <strong>Surgery (Hysterectomy):</strong> Removes the uterus completely — effective, but need 4-6 weeks bed recovery, cause permanent loss of fertility and can cause potential complications like urine leakage, bladder damage and permanent loss of urinary control.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myomectomy:</strong> Cuts out part of uterus where fibroids are present while keeping rest of uterus intact - while it can technically allow pregnancy (almost always requiring a C-section), and the surgery is complex with a risk of urinary issues like hysterectomy and also excessive blood loss (since the uterus has a significantly high blood supply compared to other internal organs).

                How Is UFE Different?
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
                UFE works without cutting or removing anything.
                An interventional radiologist guides a thin wire from your wrist to the uterus using real-time imaging with advanced equipment, and then blocking only the vessels feeding the fibroids. Over the next few weeks your fibroids shrink in size, all symptoms including bleeding and pain disappear, and your uterus stays intact.
