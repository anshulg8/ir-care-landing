                        <li>Your joint discomfort is likely due to early inflammation or mild mechanical (physical) stress on the joint, common with daily activity.</li>
                        <li>At this stage, cartilage and tissues are intact, and your body’s healing response is active.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold my-3">What Does This Mean? </h3>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-8">
                        <li>Most people (up to <b>80%</b>) experiencing mild joint pain respond excellently to conservative methods - physiotherapy, targeted exercises, lifestyle adjustments, and simple anti-inflammatory treatments – without needing any long-term pills or surgery.</li>
                        <li>Acting now significantly reduces your risk of progressing to chronic inflammation or structural joint damage.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold my-3">Evidence-Based Next Steps:</h3>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-8">
                        <li><b>Consistent Exercise:</b> Clinical studies show regular guided exercise reduces pain by <b>30-40%</b> and can delay or even prevent chronic progression.</li>
                        <li><b>Nutrition Optimization:</b> Anti-inflammatory diets (rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants) reduce inflammatory markers and pain symptoms significantly.</li>

                        <li>At moderate severity, persistent inflammation has started damaging tissues near your joint. Small blood vessels around your joint become chronically inflamed and start growing in size and number (neo-angiogenesis), increasing pain signals to your brain.</li>
                        <li>At this stage, conservative therapies alone (physiotherapy, exercise, lifestyle changes) often provide only temporary relief.</li>

                            Severe pain indicates chronic inflammatory damage with extensive abnormal micro-vessel growth around your joint,
                            which will likely get worse over time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Persistent severe pain significantly interferes with daily life, sleep quality, emotional health, and overall wellbeing.

                        <li>
                            With severe joint pain, conventional treatments (medications, injections, physiotherapy) typically offer limited effectiveness or temporary relief – clinical evidence shows only <b>10–20%</b> long-term effectiveness.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Without targeted treatment, many patients often move towards more invasive surgeries (joint replacements) – which carry higher risks, longer recoveries, and substantial costs.
