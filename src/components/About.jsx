                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Why Interventional Radiology?</h3>
                    <p>
                        IR procedures are performed using advanced imaging (like CT, ultrasound, or fluoroscopy) to guide tiny instruments through the body. They offer less pain, minimal downtime, and fewer risks than conventional surgery â€” making them ideal for a wide range of conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whether you're facing uterine fibroids, varicose veins, an enlarged prostate, or certain tumors, IR might be the safer, faster alternative you've been looking for.
