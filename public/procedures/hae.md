## **How are Hemorrhoids (Piles) affecting you?**

The inner part of your anal opening is filled with dense blood vessel cushions which help us in both pushing stool out, and closing the opening. In some of us, these cushions become thick and swollen, causing bleeding, itching and finally prolapse (falling out). 

## **What are your treatment options?**

The best solution for Piles depends on your stage of disease and severity of symptoms, but treatment is a necessity - if untreated, it gets progressively worse, ultimately leading to further bleeding and prolapse, and in some cases even ulceration (open wounds), infection and necrosis (black dead tissue).

In initial stages of the disease (when bleeding is less, lifestyle changes like high fibre diets, oral flavonoids (natural supplement pills) and a variety of anal creams - but the moment the disease starts becoming more severe (eg persistent
Grade II–III disease where frequency of fresh bleeding increases, and prolapse starts occuring with pressure), a physical intervention becomes necessary.

Traditional surgery (open or stapled hemorrhoidectomy, hemorrhoidopexy, DG-HAL) works by removing some or the entire problematic anal vessels, but requires a major surgery and anesthesia (putting you to sleep), causing weeks of intense pain, and has significant risks like fecal incontinence (lose of stool control because of nerves cut), stricture (anal opening block due to scarring), inability to pass urine (due to intense pain) or anal fistula formation (hole between anus and another opening, causing stool leak from another area). Non-surgical options like Rubber Band Ligation, Sclerotherapy Injection don't have such complications but have a higher reoccurence rate and further bleeding later, and can only be used in initial stages of the disease.

## **What exactly is HAE (Hemorrhoidal Artery Embolization), or Pin-hole Piles Procedure?**

Our interventional radiologist inserts a hair-thin catheter into a pin-hole from your wrist/groin, and under continuous real-time X-ray monitoring, they move this catheter wire via the blood vessel system of the body to reach the piles vessels. Then, after identifying the problematic blood vessels which are causing you this problem, they push advanced micro-coils or particles into the vessels which block only those tiny branches, leaving other blood supply intact; blood flow drops, those anal cushions shrink, and the bleeding stops—all while you are wide awake, without even taking off your pants.

## **Is HAE the right procedure for you?**

While a detailed analysis is required to analyse which procedure is perfectly suited to help a patient get the best result, there are some general guidelines you can use to see if HAE is a good fit for you or your loved one.

**HAE may work best for you if:**

* Bleeding or itching is the main symptom of your piles (and not advanced stage prolapse i.e. falling out) - since HAE works via the blood supply system, not cutting or stapling the area directly.
* You have tried banding, injection or surgery and it has not worked - this is the most common group of people who get an HAE, unfortunately after all other options have been exhausted.
* You cannot undergo surgery because of high risk (eg you have serious heart/lung disease or uncontrolled diabetes, you are on blood thinners etc)
* You want minimal pain and instant recovery but with no risks.

**Similarly, HAE is NOT recommended for you if:**

* You have a massive grade 4 prolapse (i.e. piles vessels are always outside your anal opening, and cannot be reduced back in) - you will need surgery to staple the prolapsed vessels back in.
* You have an anal fissure (painful crack/wound near outer anus) or fistula (opening between anus and another area).
* You have cancer, or your doctor suspects cancer and needs some tissue for biopsy study - since we don't cut anything, we can't take a tissue sample.
* You have severe external/outer piles (per a doctor opinion) - HAE simply won't work in this case.

## **The Perfect Candidate**

| ✅ Ideal for HAE | ❌ Better Suited to Surgery / Other |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Grade II-III internal hemorrhoids with troublesome bleeding | Massive, irreducible Grade IV prolapse             |
| Failed / relapsed after banding or injection                | Concomitant anal fissure, fistula or cancer        |
| High-surgical-risk (heart, lung, diabetes, anticoagulants)  | Need histology for suspected neoplasm              |
| Wants minimal pain & instant recovery                       | Severe external piles only (no internal component) |
