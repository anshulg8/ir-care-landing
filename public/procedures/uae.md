## **Why Do Fibroids Wreck Your Life?**
Uterine fibroids trigger relentless heavy periods, pelvic pressure, bloating and anaemia. Tablets and IUDs often fail; myomectomy or hysterectomy solve symptoms but demand general anaesthesia, weeks off work and, for hysterectomy, permanent loss of fertility.

## **Enter UAE—Modern, Scar-Free Fibroid Therapy**
Guided by live X-ray, our interventional radiologist threads a micro-catheter from the wrist to the uterine arteries. Microscopic beads block only the vessels feeding your fibroids; tumours starve, shrink 40–60 %, and symptoms melt away—*without removing* your uterus or cutting abdominal muscles.

## **Who Is an Ideal Candidate**

| ✅ Perfect for UAE | ❌ Better Served by Surgery |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Heavy bleeding, prolonged periods, bulk pain | Active fertility plan < 12 months (myomectomy first-line) |
| Multiple or difficult-to-reach fibroids | Submucosal fibroid < 3 cm causing infertility |
| Moderate–large uterus (10–20 weeks size) | Suspicion of malignancy |
| Age 30 – 50 desiring organ preservation | Fibroid size > 25 weeks + severe prolapse |
| Medical comorbidities or anaesthesia risk | |

*Unsure? Upload your MRI—our team will confirm in 24h if UAE fits your goals.*
