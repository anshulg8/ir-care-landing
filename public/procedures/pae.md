## **Why Does BPH Hurt Your Life?**

An enlarged prostate squeezes the urethra, causing night-time trips to the bathroom, weak flow and incomplete emptying. Medicines can take months and don’t always work; surgery (TURP) fixes flow quickly but brings hospital stay, spinal anesthesia and high rates of retrograde ejaculation or strictures.

## **Enter PAE—Modern, Minimally Invasive**

Our interventional radiologist navigates a micro-catheter from a wrist artery to the tiny prostate arteries and releases microscopic beads that choke the abnormal blood flow. The gland shrinks, pressure drops and symptoms melt away—**without** cutting or cautery.

## **Who Is a Perfect Candidate?**

| ✅ Ideal Candidates | ❌ Not Ideal (Consider TURP / UroLift) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| IPSS >13, prostate >40g | Neurogenic bladder |
| Bleeding disorders / on blood thinners | Severe (> +2) median lobe intrusion |
| Cardiac, pulmonary or uncontrolled diabetes | Prostate cancer |
| Values sexual function & fast recovery | Wants tissue for histology |

## **PAE vs Traditional TURP**

| Factor | PAE | TURP |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Anesthesia** | Local + mild sedation | Spinal/general |
| **Hospital Stay** | **0 days** (outpatient) | 2-3 days |
| **Ejaculatory Dysfunction** | 10-16% | 50%+ |
| **Erectile Dysfunction** | <5% | ~6% |
| **Stricture / incontinence** | Rare (< 1 %)    | 5-7% |
| **IPSS improvement @ 12 m** | -15 points | -18 points |
| **Need for retreatment @ 5 y** | 15-20% | 6-10% |

## **Step-by-Step Journey**

1. **30-min Video or Clinic Consult** – review MRI, PSA, IPSS.
2. **Morning Procedure** – wrist pin-hole, live mapping, 45-60 min embolization.
3. **Relax & Discharge** within 4 h, drive next day.
4. **Follow-up Call (Day 3)** – most men note better stream already.
5. **Clinic Visit (Month 1)** – repeat IPSS & ultrasound; 80 % show ≥ 50 % volume shrink.

## **World-Class Expertise, Right Here**
